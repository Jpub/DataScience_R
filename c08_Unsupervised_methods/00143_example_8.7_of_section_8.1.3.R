}

# Note 1: 
#   Function to calculate squared distance 
#   between two vectors. 

# Note 2: 
#   Function to calculate the WSS for a single 
#   cluster, which is represented as a matrix (one row 
#   for every point). 

# Note 3: 
#   Calculate the centroid of the cluster (the 
#   mean of all the points). 

# Note 4: 
#   Calculate the squared difference of every 
#   point in the cluster from the centroid, and sum 
#   all the distances. 

# Note 5: 
#   Function to compute the total WSS from a set 
#   of data points and cluster labels. 

# Note 6: 
#   Extract each cluster, calculate the 
#   clusterâ€™s WSS, and sum all the values.
