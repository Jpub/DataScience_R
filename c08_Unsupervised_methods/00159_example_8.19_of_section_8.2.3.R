# Note 1: 
#   Call apriori() with a minimum support of 
#   0.002 and a minimum confidence of 0.75. 

# Note 2: 
#   The summary of the apriori() output reports 
#   the number of rules found;... 

# Note 3: 
#   ...the distribution of rule lengths (in this 
#   example, most rules contain 3 itemsâ€”2 on the left 
#   side, X (lhs), and one on the right side, Y 
#   (rhs));... 

# Note 4: 
#   ...a summary of rule quality measures, 
#   including support and confidence;... 

# Note 5: 
#   ...and some information on how apriori() was 
#   called.
