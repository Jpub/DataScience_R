# Note 1: 
#   The call to interestMeasure() takes as 
#   arguments the discovered rules,... 

# Note 2: 
#   ...a list of interest measures to 
#   apply,... 

# Note 3: 
#   ...and a dataset to evaluate the interest 
#   measures over. This is usually the same set used 
#   to mine the rules, but it neednâ€™t be. For 
#   instance, you can evaluate the rules over the full 
#   dataset, bookbaskets, to get coverage estimates 
#   that reflect all the customers, not just the ones 
#   who showed interest in more than one book.
