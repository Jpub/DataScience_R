hh <- unique(hhdata$household_id) 	# Note: 1 
households <- data.frame(household_id = hh, gp = runif(length(hh))) 	# Note: 2 
hhdata <- merge(hhdata, households, by="household_id") 	# Note: 3

# Note 1: 
#   Get all unique household IDs from your data 
#   frame. 

# Note 2: 
#   Create a temporary data frame of household IDs 
#   and a uniformly random number from 0 to 1. 

# Note 3: 
#   Merge new random sample group column back into 
#   original data frame.
