# Note 1: 
#   Build synthetic examples. 

# Note 2: 
#   Add in Caco2 to absorption relation learned from original dataset. Note the relation is 
#   positive: better Caco2 always drives better absorption in our 
#   synthetic dataset. Weâ€™re log transforming Caco2, as it has over 3 
#   decades of range. 

# Note 3: 
#   Add in a mean-0 term that depends on time to simulate the effects of improvements as the 
#   project moves forward. 

# Note 4: 
#   Add in a mean-0 noise term.
