# Note 1: 
#   The loaded object uciCar is of type data.frame. 

# Note 2: 
#   The [1] is just an output sequence 
#   marker. The actual information is this: uciCar has 
#   1728 rows and 7 columns. Always try to confirm you 
#   got a good parse by at least checking that the 
#   number of rows is exactly one fewer than the 
#   number of lines of text in the original file. The 
#   difference of one is because the column header 
#   counts as a line, but not as a data row.
