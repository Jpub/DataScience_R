# Note 1: 
#   Where we found the data documentation. This 
#   is important to record as many data files donâ€™t 
#   contain links back to the documentation. Census 
#   PUMS does in fact contain embedded documentation, 
#   but not every source is so careful. 

# Note 2: 
#   How we navigated from the documentation site 
#   to the actual data files. It may be necessary to 
#   record this if the data supplier requires any sort 
#   of click-through license to get to the actual 
#   data. 

# Note 3: 
#   The actual files we downloaded. 

# Note 4: 
#   The sizes of the files after we downloaded 
#   them. 

# Note 5: 
#   Cryptographic hashes of the file contents we 
#   downloaded. These are very short summaries (called 
#   hashes) that are very unlikely to have the same 
#   value for different files. These summaries can 
#   later help us determine if another researcher in 
#   our organization is using the same data 
#   distribution or not.
