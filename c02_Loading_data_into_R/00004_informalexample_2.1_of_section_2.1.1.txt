# Note 1: 
#   csv (comma-separated values)structured file formatsThe header row contains the names of the data 
#   columns, in this case separated by commas. When 
#   the separators are commas, the format is called 
#   comma-separated values, or 
#   .csv. 

# Note 2: 
#   The data rows are in the same format as the 
#   header row, but each row contains actual data 
#   values. In this case, the first row represents the 
#   set of name/value pairs: buying=vhigh, 
#   maintenance=vhigh, doors=2, persons=2, and so 
#   on.
