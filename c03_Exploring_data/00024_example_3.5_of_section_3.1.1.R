##    -8.7    14.6    35.0    53.5    67.0   615.0

# Note 1: 
#   The variable Income is defined as Income = custdata$income/1000. But suppose you didn’t know 
#   that. Looking only at the summary, the values could plausibly be 
#   interpreted to mean either “hourly wage” or “yearly income in units 
#   of $1000.”
